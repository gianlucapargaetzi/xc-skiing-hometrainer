Hello

I want to program a web-based Python application using Flask, HTML and CSS
The whole GUI should be styled in a simplistic "Apple-Style".

On the right side, there is a fixed size "Task Bar" with the GUI logo, a Settings Button and a Button to start / stop.
Pushing the settings button should open another tab with all settings which can be changed.

In the Middle. There should be some kind of "Tab View"-Section, where i can switch between a Map Controlled Mode and a Manual Control Mode.

In the Map Control Mode. I want to be able to browse a local .gpx file and upload it to the GUI.
The uploaded .gpx file should be displayed in the map and also the elevation profile should be plotted on the bottom.
Additionally, i want to display my current GPS location from backend to the frontend map and elevation.

On the right side (The border between middle view and right view should be adjustable), i want a "Anayltics"-Section.
On the top there should be a list of check boxes with different values that can be displayed as graphs in a scroll view below.
The height of each graph should be adjustable.
